                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> sole business of a seaman on shore, who has to go to sea again, 
is to take as much pleasure as he can. The moment he sets his foot 
on dry-ground, he turns his back on all salt-beef and other salt-water 
restrictions. His long absence, and the impossibility of getting land 
pleasures at sea, put him upon a sort of desperate appetite. He lands, 
like a conqueror taking possession. He has been debarred so long, 
that he is resolved to have that matter out with the inhabitants. They 
must render an account to him of their treasures, their women, their 
victualling-stores<note type="editorial">Victualling was the naval
    practice of equipping a ship with food and other supplies, as well as arms in the case of war ships.

sure your lady does not expect it, or I should have had none but men
for listeners on this subject. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#lady-m">
<speaker>Lady's M. </speaker><p>Oh, Sir, if my lady does not think it vulgar, I'm Sure 
I shan't; for there isn't a more delicater nor more genteeler person 
than my lady in all England, though I say it to her face who shouldn't. 
But you mentioned something about alehouses, or inns, or something; 
and you know they are rather vulgar. </p>
</sp>
<sp who="#indi">
<speaker>Indic. </speaker><p>I'm sure, Mrs. Jane, I didn't think so, three years back, 
when you handed me that frothed glass of porter, with your pretty 
fingers, on a hot summer's day, under the great elm-tree there, at the 
door of the Jolly Miller. </p>

the rheumatiz, all along of that vixen (God forgive me!) my own 
great aunt, who wouldn't let her come home one night in the shay, 
because she had married Tom Butts after being the wife of a Serjeant 
of Dragoons. And yet I must say for Mr. Butts, that for a landlord, 
and a man in a vulgarish situation, he was as well-behaved a man 
though a bold one, and might hold up his head as high, and was as 
kind and good-natured, and was as free from pride, and said as civil 
things to a body—— </p>

<speaker>Lady. </speaker><p>In short, Jane, he was not vulgar, and your dear old vixen 
of a great aunt was. There is no vulgarity, child, but impertinence

or having a feeling for all, and being ashamed of it. Remember the 
ragged sailor whom you kissed. </p>

<speaker>Lady's M. </speaker><p>Lord, Ma'am, and did you see me kiss my poor brother
William? For it was my own brother. Ma'am, who you've
heard me speak of—in the navy; and he was so ragged then, because 
he had to cross the whole country to his home, and had spent all his 
money at Portsmouth; and so I gave him my box of half-crowns, and 
he's now captain's clerk's man, and it was he as sent me that live tortoise 
that made me scream so, and the cocoa-cup, and the shawl, and 
the purse made of grass, and the Hoty-hity feathers; and I do think, if 
he was here, I could kiss him again, if he was as ragged as a rag-or-a-muffin, 
before all the world, aye, even before Sally Jones. </p>

or a Trifle, as they very properly calls it, from Margate, with 
a piece of looking-glass in the inside, to see her proud, affected, niminy-piminy face in. </p>

him before her once; as if one's brother was'nt one's brother; and as

make any thing like an advantage. She is but a maid at boarding-school,

whenever she goes home to her father's, who is nothing but a little 
petty green-grocer in an alley, she insists, forsooth, on my Missing and

Missing her, or she wont send me any news of the private theatre; and 
and she knows that vexes me, because I really have a taste for the stage,

never condescends to write Miss to me, though she daredn't wear her

always permits me to wear my hair in a comb, to distinguish me from 
common helpers and such like. And besides that, though I have worn 
a cap, I never wore black worsted stockings as she does; nor never 
set mop upon floor. As to sailors, she cannot abide 'en. </p>

Indic. But you, Mrs. Jane, can : and let me t^ll you, that that is not 
ithe least advantage which you have over Miss Sarah Jones. So we will 
^o on with our picture. 


The first object of the seaman on landing is to spend his money : but 
his first sensation is the strange firmness of the earth, which he goes 
dreading in a sort of heavy light way, half waggoner and half dancing- 
master, his shoulders rolling, and his feet touching and going ; tlie 
5ame way, in short, in which he keeps himself prepared for all the rol-; 
ling chances of the vessel, when on deck. There is always, to us, this 
appearance of lightness of foot and heavy strength of upper works, in a, 
sailor. And he feels it himself. He lets his jacket fly open, and his 
shoulders slouch, and his hair grow long to be gathered into a heavy 
pigtail ; but when full dressed, he prides himself on a certain gentility 
.of toe; on a white stocking and a natty shoe, issuing lightly out of the 
flowing blue trowser. His arms are neutral, hanging and swinging in a 
jcurve aloof; his hands, half open, look as if they had just been 
handling ropes, and had no object in life but to handle them again. He 
is proud of appearing in a new hat and slops, with a Belcher handker-, 
.chief flowing loosely round his neck, and the corner of another out ot 
his pocket. Thus equipped, with pinchbeck buckles in his shoes 
(which he bought for gold) he puts some tobacco in his mouth, not as if 
he were going to use it directly, but as if he stufltd it in a pouch on 
one side, as a pelican does fish, to employ it hereafter : and so, with 
Bet Monson at his side, and perhaps a cane or whanghee twisted under 
his other arm, sallies forth to take possession of all Lubberland. He 
buys every thingihat he comes athwart, — nuts, gingerbread, apples, 
shoe-strings, beer, brandy, gin, buckles, knives, a watch, (two, if he 
has money enough), gowns and handkerchiefs for Bet, and his mother 
and sisters, dozens of " Superfine Best Men's Cotton Stockings," 
dozens of '^ Superfine Best Women's Cotton Ditto," best good Check 
for Shirts (though he has too much already), infinite needles and thread 
(to sew hjs trowsers with some day), a footman's laced hat, Bear's 
Grease to make his hair grow (by way of joke,) several sticks, all sorts 
of Jew articles, a flute (which he can't play, and never intends), a leg 
of mutton which he carries somewhere to roast, and for a piece of 
whi^h the landlord of the Ship makes him pay twice what he gave for 
the whole ; — in short, all that money can be spent upon, which is 
every thing but mediciuc gratis; and this he would insist on paying 




180 THE INDICATOR. 


for. He would buy all the painfcd parrots on an Italian's head, ofi 
purpose to break them, rather than not spend his money. He has 
fiddles and a dance at the Ship, with oceans of flip and grog ; and gives 
the blind fiddler tobacco for sweetmeats, and half a crown for tread- 
ing on his toe. He asks the landlady, with a sigh, after her daughter 
Nance who first fired his heart with her silk-stockings; and finding 
that she is married and in trouble, leaves five cro\yns for her; which 
the old lady appropriates as part payment for a shilling in advance. 
He goes to the port playhouse with Bet Mpnson, and a great red hand- 
Jcerchief full of apples, gingerbread nuts, and fresh beef; calls out for 
the fiddlers and Rule 13ritannia ; pelts Tom Sikes in the pit ; and com- 
pares Othello to the black ship's cook in his white night-cap. When 
lie comes to London, he and some messmates take a hackney-coach, full 
of Bet Monsons and tobacco-pipes, and go through the streets smoking; 
and lolling out of window. He has ever been cautious of ven- 
turing'on horseback; and among his other sights in foreign parts, 
Telates with unfeigned astonishment how he has seen the Turk^ 
yidp, — " Only," says he, guarding against the hearer's incredu- 
lity, " they have saddle-boxes to hold 'em in, fore and aft ; 
and shovels like for stirrups.'' He will tell you how the Chinese 
drink, and the Necuus dance, and the monkies pelt you with 
cocoa-nuts; and how King Domy would have built him a mud hut 
and made him a Peer of the Realm, if he would have stopped with 
hira and taught hiiri to make trowsers. He has q. sister at a " School 
for Young Ladies," who blushes with a mixture of pleasure and shame 
'at his appearance ; and whose confusion he completes, by slipping 
four-pence into her hand, and" saying out loud that he has '' no more 
copper" about him. His mother and elder sisters at home doat on all 
he says and does, telling him however that he is a great sea-fellow, 
and \Vas always wild ever since he was a hop-o'-my-thumb no higher 
than the window-locker. He tells his mother that she would be a 
Duchess in Paranaboo ; at which the good old portly dame laughs and 
looks proud. When his sisters complain of his roniping, he says that 
they are pnly sorj-y it is not the baker. He frightens them with a 
mask made after the New Zealand fashion, and is forgiven for his 
learning. Their mantle-piece is filled by him with shells and shark's 
teeth; and when he goes to sea again, there is no end of tears, and 
God-bless yous, and home-made gingerbread. 


His Officer on shore does much of all this, only, generally speaking, 
in a higher taste. The moment he lands he buys quantities of jewel- 
lery and other valuables, for all the females of his acquaintance ; and 
is taken in for every article. He sends in a cart load of fresh meat to 
the ship, though he is going to town next day ; and calling in at a 
cliandk^'s fpr some candles, is persuaded to buy a dozgn of green wax^ 
yvith-rt'hich he lights up the ship at evening; regretting that the fine 
moonlight hinders the effect of the colour. A man, with a bundle 
beneath his arm, acqosts him in an under-tone ; and, with a look in 
■which respect for his knowledge is mixed with an avowed zeal for his 
own interest, asks if his Honour will just step under the gangway 
hQrr., and inspect some real India shawls. The gallant Lieutenant 




* tllE INDICATOR. J8l 


«pys fb himself, '* This fellow knows what's what, by h»s face;" and 
feo he proves it by being taken in on the spot. When he brings the 
shawls home, he says to his sister with an air of triumph, ^' There, 
Poll, there's something for you ; only cost me twelve, and is worth 
twenty, if it's worth a dollar." She turns pale — " Twenty what, my 
dear George ? Why, you haven't given twelve dollars for it, I hope?" 
" Not f, by the Lord.'' — " That's lucky; because you see, ray dear 
George, that all together is not worth more than fourteen or fifteea 
shillings." " Fourteen or fifteen what ! Why, it's real India, en't it? 
Why the fellow told me so ; or I'm sure I'd as soon" — (here he tries 
to hide his blushes with a bluster) *' I'd as soon have given him twelve 
douses on the chaps as twelve guineas." '■* Twelve guineas," ex- 
claims the sister ; and th«n drawling forth " Why — my^ — deak— ^ 
George,'^ is proceeding to shew him Avhat the articles would have cost 
at Condell's, when he interrupts her by requesting her to go and 
chuse for herself a tea-table service. He then makes his escape to 
some messmates at a coffee-house, and drowns his recollection of the 
shawls in the best wine, and a discussion on the comparative merits of 
the English and West Indian beauties and tables. At the theatre 
afterwards, where he has never been before, he takes a lady at the 
back of one of the boxes for a woman of qnaflty ; and when, after 
returning his. long respectfnl gaze with a smile, she turns aside and 
puts her handkerchief to her mouth, he thinks it is in derision, till his 
friend undeceives him. He is introduced to the lady ; and ever after- 
wards, at first sight of a woman of quality (without any disparage- 
ment either to those charming personages), expects her to give him a 
smile. He thinks the other ladies much better creatures than they are 
tsiken for ; and for their parts, they tell him, that if all men were Hke 
himselfj they would trust the se-x again ; — which, for aught we know, 
is the truth. He has, indeed, what he thinks a very liberal opinion of 
ladies in general; judging them all, in a manner, with the eye of a 
.seaman's experience. Yet he will believe nevertheless in the " trwe- 
love" of any given damsel whom he seeks in the way of marriage, let 
him roam as much, or remain as long at a distance, as he pleases. It 
is not that he wants feeling ; but that he has read of it, time out of 
niind, in songs; and he looks upon constancy as a sort of exploit, 
answering to those which he performs at sea. He is nice in his 
watches and linen. He makes you presents of cornelians, antique 
seals, cocoa-nuts get in silver, and other valuables. When he shakes 
hands with you, it is like being caught in a windlass. He would not 
jswagger about the streets in his uniform, for the world. He is gene- 
rally modest in company, though liable to be irritated by what he 
thinks ungeutlemanly behaviour. He is also liable to be rendered 
irritable by sickness; partly because he has been used to command 
others, and to be served with all possible deference and alacrity ; and 
partly, because the idea of suffering pain, vrithout any honour or profit 
jto get by it, is unprofessional, and he is not accustomed to it. He 
.treats talenls unlike his^-own with great respect. He often perceives 
ihis own so little felt tliat it teaches him this feeling for thai of others. ' 
Besid;cs, l;e admires the quantity of information which people can get.
