                    <p>There  is  a  bird  in  the  interior  of  Africa,  whose  habits  would  rather  seem  to  belong  to  the  interior  of Fairy-land:  but  they  have  been,  well  authenticated.  It  indicates  to  honey-hunters  where  the  nests  of  wild bees  are  to  be  found.  It  calls  them  with  a  cheerful  cry,  which  they  answer;  and  on  finding  itself  recognized, flies  and  hovers  over  a  hollow  tree  containing  the  honey.  While  they  are  occupied  in  collecting  it,  the  bird goes  to  a  little  distance,  where  he  observes  all  that  passes;  and  the  hunters,  wnen  they  have  helped  themselves, take  care  to  leave  him  his  portion  of  the  food. — This  is  the  <hi rend="smallcaps">Cuculus Indicator  of  Linnæus</hi>,  otherwise called  the  Moroc,  Bee  Cuckoo,  or  Honey  Bird.</p>

                    <head type="header">TO ANY ONE WHOM BAD WEATHER DEPRESSES. </head>
                    
                    <p>If you are melancholy for the first time, you will find upon a little  
enquiry, that others have been melancholy many times, and yet are  
cheerful now. If you have been melancholy many times, recollect  
that you have got over all those times; and try if you cannot find  
out new means of getting over them better. </p>

<p>Do not imagine that mind alone is concerned in your bad spirits.  
The body has a great deal to do with these matters. The mind may  
undoubtedly affect the body; but the body also affects the mind.  
There is a mutual re-action between them; and by lessening it on  
either side, you diminish the pain on both. </p>

<p>If you are melancholy, and know not why, be assured it must  
arise entirely from some physical weakness; and do your best to  
strengthen yourself. The blood of a melancholy man is thick and slow.  
The blood of a lively man is clear and quick. Endeavour therefore  
to put your blood in motion. Exercise is the best way to do it; but  
you may also help yourself, in moderation, with wine, or other  
excitements. Only you must take care so to proportion the use of any  
artificial stimulus, that it may not render the blood languid by over-  
exciting it at first; and that you may be able to keep up, by the  
natural stimulus only, the help you have given yourself by the artificial.  
Regard the bad weather, as somebody has advised us to handle the  
nettle. In proportion as you are delicate with it, it will make you  
feel but </p>

<lg><l>Grasp it like a man of mettle. </l> 
<l>And the rogue obeys you well. </l></lg>

<p>Do not the less however, on that account, take all reasonable  
precaution and arms against it, — your boots, etc. against wet feet,  
and your great coat or umbrella against the rain. It is timidity and  
flight, which are to be deprecated, not proper armour for the battle.  
Tht first will lay you open to defeat, on the least attack. A proper  
use of the latter will only keep you strong for it. Plato had such  
a high opinion of exercise, that he said it was a cure even for a  

<pb n="34"/>

wounded conscience. Nor is this opinion a dangerous one. For  
there is no system, even of superstition, however severe or cruel in  
other matters, that does not allow a wounded conscience to be curable  
by some means. Nature will work out it's rights and it's kindness  
some way or other, through the worst sophistications; and this is  
one of the instances in which she seems to raise herself above all  
contingencies. The conscience may have been wounded by artificial  
or by real guilt; but then she will tell it in those extremities, that  
even the real guilt may have been produced by circumstances. It  
is her kindness alone, which nothing can pull down from it's <choice>
<orig>pre-dominance</orig>
<reg>predominance</reg>
</choice>. </p>

<p>See fair play between cares and pastimes. Diminish your mere  
wants as much as possible, whether you are rich or poor: for the  
rich man's wants, increasing by indulgence, are apt to outweigh  
even the abundance of his means; and the poor man's diminution  
of them renders his means the greater. Do not want money, for  
instance, for money's sake. There is excitement in the pursuit; but it  
is dashed with more troubles than most others, and gets less happiness  
at last. On the other hand, increase all your natural and healthy  
enjoyments. Cultivate your afternoon fireside, the society of your  
friends, the company of agreeable children, music, theatres, amusing  
books, an urbane and generous gallantry. He who thinks any  
innocent pastime foolish, has either yet to grow wiser or is past it.  
In the one case, his notion of being childish is itself a childish  
notion. In the other, his importance is of so feeble and hollow a cast,  
that it dare not move for fear of tumbling to pieces. </p>

<p>A friend of ours, who knows as well as any man how to unite  
industry with enjoyment, has set an excellent example to those who  
can afford the leisure, by taking two Sabbaths every week instead of  
one;— not Methodistical Sabbaths, but days of rest which pay true  
homage to the Supreme Being by enjoying his creation. He will  
be gratified at reading this paragraph on his second-Sunday morning. </p>

<p>One of the best pieces of advice for an ailing spirit is to go to  
no sudden extremes, — to adopt no great and extreme changes in  
diet or other habits. They may make a man look very great and  
philosophic to his own mind; but they are not fit for a nature, to  
which custom has been truly said to be a second nature. Dr. Cheyne  
(as we remember reading on a stall) may tell us that a drowning  
man cannot too quickly get himself out of the water: but the  
analogy is not good. If the water has become a second habit, he might  
almost as well say that a fish could not get too quickly out of it. </p>

<p>Upon this point. Bacon says that we should discontinue what we  
think hurtful by little and little. And he quotes with admiration  
the advice of Celsus, — that "a man do vary and interchange  
contraries, but rather with an inclination to the more benign extreme."  
"Use fasting," he says, "and full eatipg, but rather full eating;  
watching and sleep, but rather sleep; sitting and exercise, but  
rather exercise, and the like, so shall nature be cherished, and yet   
taught masteries." </p>

<pb n="35"/>

<p>We cannot do better than conclude with one or two other passages  
out of the same Essay, full of his usual calm wisdom. "If you fly  
physic in health altogether, it will be too strange for your body when  
you need it." (He means that a general state of health should not make  
us over-confident and contemptuous of physic; but that we should  
use it moderately if required, that it may not be too strange to us  
when required most.) "If you make it too familiar, it will have  
no extraordinary effect when sickness cometh. I commend rather  
some diet for certain seasons, than frequent use of physic, except it  
be grown into a custom: for those diets alter the body more, and  
trouble it less." </p>

<p>"As for the passions and studies of the mind," says he, "avoid  
envy, anxious fears, anger fretting inwards, subtil and knotty  
inquisitions, joys and exhilirations in excess, sadness not communicated"  
(for as he says finely, somewhere else. They who keep their griefs  
to themselves, are "cannibals of their own hearts.") "Entertain  
hopes; mirth rather than joy;" (that is to say, cheerfulness rather  
than what we call boisterous merriment); "variety of delights  
rather than surfeit of them; wonder and admiration, and therefore  
novelties; studies that fill the mind with splendid and illustrious  
objects, as histories, fables, and contemplations of nature." </p>

<head type="header">CHARLES BRANDON, AND MARY QUEEN OF FRANCE. </head>

<p>The fortune of Charles Brandon was remarkable. He was an  
honest man, yet the favourite of a despot. He was brave, handsome,  
accomplished, possessed even delicacy of sentiment; yet he  
retained his favour to the last. He even had the perilous honour of  
being beloved by the despot's sister, without having the least claim  
to it by birth; and yet instead of it's destroying them both, he was  
allowed to be her husband. </p>

<p>Charles Brandon was the son of Sir William Brandon, whose skull  
was cleaved at Bosworth by Richard the Third, while bearing the  
standard of the Duke of Richmond. Richard dashed at the standard,  
and appears to have been thrown from his horse by Sir William,  
whose strength and courage however could not save him from the  
angry desperation of the king.</p>

<cit><quote><lg><l>But Time, whose wheeles with various motion runne, </l>
<l>Repayes this service fully to his Sonne, </l>
<l>Who marries Richmond's daughter, born betweene </l>
<l>Two royal parents, and endowed a queene. </l></lg></quote>
<note type="source"><bibl><author>Sir John Beaumont</author>'s <title>Bosworth Field</title>.</bibl></note></cit> 

<p>The father's fate must doubtless have had it's effect in securing the 
fortunes of the son. Young Brandon, we believe, grew up with Henry  
the Seventh's children, and was the playmate of his future king and  
bride. The prince, as he increased in years, seems to have carried  
the idea of Brandon vnth him like that of a second self; and the  

<pb n="36"/>

princess, whose affection was not hindered from becoming personal  
by any thing sisterly, nor on the other hand allowed to waste itself  
in too equal a familiarity, may have felt a double impulse given to  
it by the great improbability of her ever being suffered to become  
his wife. Royal females in most countries have certainly none of the  
advantages of their rank, whatever the males may have. Mary was  
destined to taste the usual bitterness of their lot; but she was amply  
repaid. At the conclusion of the war with France, she was married  
to the old king Louis the Twelfth, who witnessed from a couch the  
exploits of her future husband at the tournaments. The doings of  
Charles Brandon that time were long remembered. The love between  
him and the young queen was suspected by the French courts  
and he had just seen her enter Paris in the midst of a gorgeous  
procession, like Aurora come to mairy Tithonus. He dealt his  
chivalry about him accordingly with such irresistible vigour, that  
the Dauphin, in a fit of jealousy, secretly introduced into the contest  
a huge German, who was thought to be of a strength incomparable.  
But Brandon grappled with him, and with seeming disdain and  
detection so pummelled him about the head with the hilt of his  
sword, that the blood burst through the vizor. Imagine the feelings  
of the queen, when he cameand made her an offering of the German's  
shield. Drayton, in his Heroical Epistles, we know not on  
what authority, tells us, that on one occasion during the combats,  
perhaps this particular one, she could not help saying out loud,  
"Hurt not my sweet Charles," or words to that effect. He then  
pleasantly represents her as doing away suspicion by falling to  
commendation of the Dauphin, and affecting not to know who the  
conquering knight was; — an ignorance not very probable; but the  
knights sometimes disguised themselves purposely. </p>

<p>The old king did not long survive his festivities. He died in less  
than three months, on the first day of the year 1515 3 and Brandon,  
who had been created Duke of Suffolk the year before, re-appeared  
at the French court, with letters of condolence, and more persuasive  
looks. The royal widow was young, beautiful, and rich; and it was  
likely that her hand would be sought by many princely lovers; but  
she was now resolved to reward herself for her late sacrifice, and in  
less than two months she privately married her first love. The  
queen, says a homely but not mean poet (Warner, in his Albion's  
England) thought that to cast too many doubts </p>

<lg><lg xml:id="verse1"><l>Were oft to erre no lesse </l>
<l>Than to be rash : and thus no doubt </l>
<l>The gentle queen did guesse, </l></lg>
<lg xml:id="verse2"><l>That seeing this or that, at first </l>
<l>Or last, had likelyhood, </l></lg>
<lg xml:id="verse3"><l>A man so much a uianly man </l>
<l>Were dastardly withstood. </l></lg>
<lg xml:id="verse4"><l>Then kisses revelled on their lips, </l>
<l>To cither's equal good. </l></lg></lg>

<p>Henry shewed great anger at first, real or pretended; but he had  
not then been pampered into unbearable self-will by a long reign of  

<pb n="37"/>

tyranny.  He soon forgave his sister and friend; and they were  
publicly wedded at Greenwich on the 13th of May. </p>

<p>It was during the festivities on this occasion (at least we believe  
so, for we have not the chivalrous Lord Herbert's life of Henry the  
8th by us, which is most probably the authority for the story; and  
being a good thing, it is omitted, as usual, by his historians) that  
Charles Brandon gave a proof of the fineness of his nature, equally  
just towards himself, and conciliating towards the jealous. He appeared  
at a tournament on a saddle-cloth, made half of frize and half  
of cloth of gold, and with a motto on each half. One of the mottos  
ran thus : — </p>

<lg><l>Cloth of frize, be not too bold, </l>
<l>- Though thou art match'd with cloth of gold. </l></lg>

<p>The other : </p>

<lg><l>Cloth of gold, do not despise, </l>
<l>Though thou art match'd with cloth of frize. </l></lg>

<p>It is this beautiful piece of sentiment which puts a heart into his  
history, and makes it worthy remembering. </p>

<div2 type="section" n="3">
<head type="header">ON THE HOUSEHOLD GODS OF THE ANCIENTS.</head>

<p>The Ancients had three kinds of household Gods, — the Daimon  
(Daemon) or Genius, the Penates, and the Lares. The first was  
supposed to be a spirit allotted to every man from his birth, some say  
with a companion; and that one of them was a suggester of good  
thoughts, and the other of evil. It seems, however, that the Genius;  
was a personification of the conscience, or rather of the prevailing  
impulses of the mind, or the other self of a man; and it was in this  
sense most likely that Socrates condescended to speak of his well-  
known Daemon, Genius, or Familiar Spirit, who, as he was a good  
man, always advised him to a good end. The Genius was thought  
to paint ideas upon the mind in as lively a manner as if in a  
looking-glass; upon which we chose which of them to adopt. Spenser,  
a most learned as well as imaginative poet, describes it in one of his  
most comprehensive though not most poetical stanzas, as </p>

<cit><quote><lg><lg xml:id="verse01">
<l>That celestial Powre, to whom the care </l>
<l>Of life, and generation of all </l>
<l>That lives, pertaine in charge particulare; </l>
<l>Who wondrous things concerning our welfare, </l>
<l>And straange phantomes doth lett us ofte foresee, </l> 
<l>And ofte of secret ills bids us beware : </l>
<l>That is our Selfe, whom though we do not see. </l>
<l>Yet each doth in himselfe it well perceive to bee. </l>
</lg>

<lg xml:id="verse02"><l>Therefore a god him sage antiquity </l>
<l>Did wisely make.</l></lg></lg></quote> 
<note type="source"><bibl><title>Faerie Queene</title>, <biblScope>Book 2, St. 47</biblScope>.</bibl></note></cit>

<p>Of the belief in an Evil Genius, a celebrated example is furnished  
in Plutarch's account of Brutus's vision, of which Shakspeare has  
given so fine a version (Julius Caesar, Act 4, Sc. 3.).  Beliefs of this  

<pb n="38"/>

kind seem traceable from one superstition to another, and in some  
instances are no doubt immediately so. But fear, and ignorance,  
and even the humility of knowledge are at hand to furnish them,  
where precedent is wanting. There is no doubt however, that the  
Romans, who copied and in general vulgarized the Greek mythology,  
took their Genius from the Greek Daimon : and as the Greek  
word has survived and taken shape in the common word Daemon,  
which by scornful reference to the Heathen religion came at last to  
signify a Devil, so the Latin word Genius, not having been used by  
the translators of the Greek Testament, has survived with a better  
meaning, and is employed to express our most genial and intellectual  
faculties. Such and such a man is said to indulge his genius : — he  
has a genius for this and that art : — he has a noble genius, an airy  
genius, an original and peculiar genius. And as the Romans from  
attributing a genius to every man at his birth, came to attribute one  
to places and to soils, and other more comprehensive peculiarities,  
so we have adopted the same use of the term into our poetical  
phraseology. We speak also of the genius, or idiomatic peculiarity,  
of a language. One of the most curious and edifying uses of the  
word Genius took place in the English translation of the French  
Arabian Nights, which speaks of o\u' old friends the Genie and the  
Genies. This is nothing more than the French word retained from  
the original translator, who applied the Roman word Genius to the  
Arabian Dive or Elf. </p>

<p>One of the stories -with which Pausanias has enlivened his  
description of Greece, is relative to a Genius. He says that one of  
the companions of Ulysses having been killed by the people of  
Temesa, they were fated to sacrifice a beautiful virgin every year  
to his manes. They were about to immolate one as usual, when  
Euthymus, a conqueror in the Olympic Games, touched with pity  
at her fate and admiration of her beauty, fell in love with her, and  
resolved to try if he could not put an end to so terrible a custom.  
He accordingly got permission from the state to marry her, provided  
he could rescue her from her dreadful expectant. He armed himself,  
waited in the temple, ' and the Genius appeared. It was said  
to have been of an appalling presence. It's shape was every way  
formidable, it's colour of an intense black; and it was girded about  
with a wolf-skin. But Euthymus fought and conquered it; upon  
which it fled madly, not only beyond the walls, but the utmost  
bounds of Temesa, and rushed into the sea. </p>

<p>The Penates were Gods of the house and family. Collectively  
speaking, they also presided over cities, public roads, aad at last over  
all places with which men were conversant. Their chief government  
however was supposed to be over the most inner and secret part  
of the house, and the subsistence and welfare of it's inmates. They  
were chosen at will out of the number of the gods, as the Roman in  
modern times chose his favourite saint. In fact, they were only the  
higher gods themselves, descending into a kind of household familiarity  
They were the personification of a particular Providence. The  

<pb n="39"/>

most striking mention of the Penates which we can call to mind is  
in one of Virgil's most poetical passages. It is where they appear  
to Mneas, to warn him from Crete, and announce his destined  
empire in Italy.  (Book 3, v. 147.) </p>

<lg xml:lang="latin"> <l>Nox erat, et terris animalia somaus habebat. </l>
<l>Effigies sacrse divom, Phrygiique Penates, </l>
<l>Quos meeum a Troja, mediisque ex ignibis urbis </l>
<l>Extuleram, visi ante oculos adstare jacentis </l>
<l>In somnis, multo manifesti luraine, qua se. </l>
<l>Plena per insertas fundebat luna fenestras. </l></lg>

<p>'Twas night; and sleep was on all living things.  
I lay, and saw before my very eyes  
Dread shapes of gods, and Phrygian -deities,  
The great Penates; whom with reverent joy  
I bore from out the heart of burning Troy.  
Plainly I saw there, standing in the light  
Which the moon poured into the room that night. </p>

<p>And again, after they had addressed him, — </p>

<lg xml:lang="latin"><l>Nee sopor illud erat; sed coram agnoscere vultus, </l>
<l>Velatasque comas, prassentiaque ora videbar: </l> 
<l>Turn gelidus toto manahat corpora sudor. </l></lg>

<p>It was no dream : I saw them face to face,  
Their hooded hair; and felt them so before  
My being, that I burst at every pore. </p>

<p>The Lares or Lars, were the lesser and most familiar household  
gods; and though their offices were afterwards extended a good deal,  
in the same way as those of the Penates, with whom they are often  
wrongly confounded, their principal sphere was the fire-place. This  
was in the middle of the room; and the statues of the Lares generally  
stood about it in little niches. They are said to have been in the  
shape of monkies; more likely mannikins, or rude little human  
images. Some were made of wax, some of stone, and others doubtless  
of any material for sculpture. They were represented with good-  
natured grinning countenances, were clothed in skins, and had little  
dogs at their feet. Some writers make them the offspring of the  
goddess Mania, who presided over the spirits of the dead; and  
suppose that originally they were the same as those spirits; which is a  
very probable as well as agreeable superstition, the old nations of  
Italy having been accustomed to bury their dead in their houses.  
Upon this supposition, the good or "benevolent spirits were called  
Familiar Lares, and the evil or malignant ones Larvaj and Lemures.  
Thus Milton, in his awful Hymn on the Nativity : — </p>

<lg><l>In consecrated earth. </l>
<l>And on the holy hearth. </l>
<l>The Lars, and Lemures moan with midnight plaint. </l>
<l>In urns and altars round, </l>
<l>A drear and dying sound </l>
<l>Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint; </l>
<l>And the chill marble seems to sweat. </l>
<l>While each peculiar Power foregoes his wanted seat. </l></lg>

<p>But Ovid tells a story of a gossiping nymph Lara, who having  
told Juno of her husband's amour with Juturna, was "sent to hell"  

<pb n="40"/>

by him, and courted by Mercury on the road 3 the consequence of  
which was the birth of the Lares. This seems to have a natural  
reference enough to the gossiping over fire-places. </p>

<p>It is impossible not to be struck with the resemblance between  
these lesser household gods and some of the offices of our old English  
elves and fairies. But of them^ more by and by. Dacier, in a note  
upon Horace (Book 1, Od. 12.) informs us, that in some parts of  
Languedoc, in his time, the fire-place was still called the Larj and  
that the name was also given to houses. </p>

<p>Heriick, an excellent poet of the Apacreontic order in the time of  
Elizabeth, whose works we shall often have occasion to recommend  
to the reader, and who was visited perhaps more than any poet that  
ever lived with a sense of the pleasantest parts of the cheerful  
mythology of the ancients, has written some of his lively little odes upon  
the Lares. We have not them by us at this moment, but we remember  
one beginning, — </p>

<lg><l>It was, and still my care is, </l>
<l>To worship you, the Lares. </l></lg>

<p>We take the opportunity of the Lars' being mentioned in it, to  
indulge ourselves, and we hope our readers, in a little poem of  
Martial's, very charming for it's simplicity. It is an Epitaph on a child  
of the name of Erotion. </p>

<lg xml:lang="latin"> <l>Hie festinata requiescit Erotion umbra, </l>
<l>Criraine quam fati sexta peremit hiems. </l>
<l>Quisquis eris nostri post me regnator agelli, </l>
<l>Manibus exiguis annua justa dato. </l>
<l>Sic Lare perpetuo, sic turba sospite, solus </l>
<l>Flebilis in terra sit lapis iste tua, </l></lg>

<lg><l>Underneath this greedy stone. </l>
<l>Lies little sweet Erotion; </l>
<l>Whom the fates, with hearts as cold. </l>
<l>Nipt away at six years old. </l>
<l>Thou, whoever thou mayst be, </l>
<l>That hast this small field after me, </l>
<l>Let the yearly rites be paid </l>
<l>To her little slender shade; </l>
<l>So shall no disease or jar </l>
<l>Hurt thy house, or chill thy Lar; </l>
<l>But this tomb here be alone, </l>
<l>The only melancholy stone. </l></lg>

<p>We understand that many of our readers mistook the story of the Beau Miser in our last number for a true one, or at least for one founded on fact. We wish to correct this mistake; and shall make a point hereafter of a wording any thing we write in the shape of a narrative, that a mere fiction shall not be confounded with our personal experience. For we would keep the truth of our testimony undisputed. — The fact is, that the story was originally intended to be one of a series told by an imaginary set of persons, after the fashion of the Decameron; and the manner of it became 
modified accordingly.</p> 

<p>The first number of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Indicator</hi> is being re-printed, and will be ready in a few days. </p>
                <p>Persons in the country who wish to become subscribers, should therefore order it of booksellers who send weekly or monthly parcels to their respective places of residence. 
                The delay would be of little consequence with a work not containing 
                any thing of merely temporary interest.</p>
