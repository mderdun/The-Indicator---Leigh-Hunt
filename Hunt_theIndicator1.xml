<p>THE INDICATOR. </p>

<p>There is a bird in the interior of Africa, whose habits would rather seem to belong to the interior of <lb/>
Fairy-land: but they have been, well authenticated. It indicates to honey-hunters where the nests of wild <lb/>
bees are to be found. It calls them with a cheerful cry, which they answer; and on finding itself recognized, <lb/>
flies and hovers over a hollow tree containing the honey. While they are occupied in collecting it, the bird <lb/>
goes to a little distance, where he observes all that passes; and the hunters, wnen they have helped <lb/>
themselves, take care to leave him his portion of the food.— This is the Cucolus-Indicator of Linnaeus, otherwise <lb/>
called the Moroc, Bee Cuckoo, or Honey Bird. </p>

<p><q>There he arriving round about doth flie. <lb/>
And takes survey with busie, curious eye: <lb/>
Now this, now that, he tasteth tenderly.— Spencer.</q></p>

<p>IT is the object of this periodical work to notice any subjects whatsoever <lb/>
within the range of the Editor's knowledge or reading. He will take them <lb/>
up, as they happen to suggest themselves; and endeavour to point out their <lb/>
essence to the reader, so as at once to be brief and satisfactory. The subjects <lb/>
will chiefly consist of curious recollections of biography; short disquisitions <lb/>
on men and things; the most interesting stories in history or fiction told <lb/>
over again, with an eye to their proper appreciation by unvulgar minds; <lb/>
and now and then a few original verses. Indeed the whole matter, whatever <lb/>
the subject may be, will be strictly original, in one sense of the word; <lb/>
arid it will be the Editor's aim, as well as a part of his own pleasure, to <lb/>
render it all as entertaining as he can. To the unvulgar he exclusively <lb/>
addresses himself; but he begs it to be particularly understood, that in this <lb/>
description of persons are to be included all those, who without having had a <lb/>
classical education, would have turned it to right account; just as all those; <lb/>
are to be excluded, who in spite of that " discipline of humanity" think <lb/>
ill of the nature which they degrade, and vulgarly confound the vulgar with <lb/>
the uneducated. </p>

<p>The Indicator will attend to no subject whatsoever of immediate or <lb/>
temporary interest. His business is with the honey in the old woods. The <lb/>
Editor has enough to agitate his spirits during the present eventful times, <lb/>
in another periodical work, and he is willing to be so agitated : but as he <lb/>
is accustomed to use his pen, as habitually as a bird his pinion, and to <lb/>
betake himself with it into the nests and bowers of more lasting speculations, <lb/>
when he has done with public ones, he is determined to keep those haunts <lb/>
of his recreation free from all noise and wrangling, both for his own pleasure <lb/>
and for those who may chuse to accompany him. </p>

<p>The Indicator will appear every Wednesday morning, at an hour early <lb/>
enough for the breakfast-table; although the subjects will not be <lb/>
temporary or those of the moment, they will be written as much at the <lb/>
moment as if they were; so that there will still be a certain freshness of <lb/>
intercourse between the Editor and his readers. </p>

<p>THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING A NAME FOR A WORK OF THIS KIND.— Never <lb/>
did gossips, when assembled to determine the name of a new-born child, <lb/>
whose family was full of conflicting interests, experience half the difficulty<lb/> 
which an author finds in settling the title for a periodical work. There is <lb/>
generally some paramount uncle, or prodigious third cousin, who is silently <lb/>
understood to have the chief claims, and to the golden lustre of whose face <lb/>
the clouds of hesitation and jealousy gradually give way. But these <lb/>
children of the brain have no godfather ready at hand : and then their single <lb/>
appellation is bound to comprise as many public interests as all the <lb/>
Christian names of a French or a German prince. It is to be modest : it is to <lb/>
be expressive : it is to be new : it is to be striking : it is to have something in <lb/>
it equally intelligible to a man of plain understanding, and surprising for <lb/>
the man of imagination : — in one word, it is to be impossible. How far <lb/>
we have succeeded in the attainment of this happy nonentity, we leave <lb/>
others to judge. There is one good thing however which the hunt after a <lb/>
title is sure to realize; — a good deal of despairing mirth. We were visiting <lb/>
a friend the other night, who can do any thing for a book but give it a <lb/>
title; and after many grave and ineffectual attempts to furnish one for the <lb/>
present, the company, after the fashion of Rabelais, and with a chair- <lb/>
shaking merriment which he might have joined in himself, fell to turning <lb/>
a hopeless thing into a jest. It was like that exquisite picture of a set of <lb/>
laughers in Shakspeare : — </p>

<q>One rubbed his elbow, thus; and fleered, and swore <lb/>
A better speech was never spoke before : <lb/>
Another, with his finger and his thumb. <lb/>
Cried " Vial We will do't, come what will come!" <lb/>
The third he capered, and cried " All goes well!" <lb/>
The fourth turned on the toe, and down he fell. <lb/>
"With that they all did tumble on the ground. <lb/>
With such a zealous laughter, so profound. <lb/>
That in this spleen ridiculous, appears, <lb/>
To check their laughter, passion's solemn tears. <lb/>
— Love's Labour Lost. </q>

<p>Some of the names had a meaning in their absurdity, such as the Adviser, <lb/>
or Helps for Composing; — the Cheap Reflector, or Every Man His Own <lb/>
Looking- Glass; — the Retailer, or Every Man His Own Other Man's Wit; <lb/>
— Nonsense, To be Continued. Others were laughable by the mere force <lb/>
of contrast, as the Crocodile, or Pleasing Companion; — Chaos, or the <lb/>
Agreeable Miscellany; — the Fugitive Guide; — the Foot-Soldier, or Flowers <lb/>
of Wit; — Bigotry, or the Cheerful Instructor; — the Polite Repository of <lb/>
Abuse; — Blood, being a Collection of Light Essays. Others were sheer <lb/>
ludicrousness and extravagance, as the Pleasing Ancestor; the Silent <lb/>
Remarker; the Tart; the Leg of Beef by a Layman; the Ingenious <lb/>
Hatband; the Booths of Bliss; the Occasional Diner; the Tooth-ache; <lb/>
Recollections of a Very Unpleasant Nature; Thoughts on Taking up a Pair of <lb/>
Snuffers; Thoughts on a Barouche-Box; Thoughts on a Hill of Considerable <lb/>
Eminence; Meditations on a Pleasing Idea; Materials for Drinking; the <lb/>
Knocker, No. I; — the Hippopotamus Entered at Stationers' Hall; the <lb/>
Piano-forte of Paulus AEmilius; the Seven Sleepers at Cards; the Arabian <lb/>
Nights on Horseback : — with an infinite number of other mortal murders <lb/>
of common sense, which rose to "push us from our stools," and which <lb/>
none but the wise or good-natured would ever think of laughing at. </p>

<p>A MISTAKE OF MR. THOMAS PAINE'S UPON LEARNING; AND A WORD <lb/>
OR TWO ON TRANSLATION. — We speak of Mr. Paine as a deceased author <lb/>
whom it is a vulgar error to under-rate. His great natural powers have <lb/>
forced themselves into eminence through every species of obstacle. Well <lb/>
aware of them himself, seeing in what manner they were often denied, and <lb/>
what a convention there was among worldly and common-place men, <lb/>
possessed of a little scholarship, to cry down every thing but themselves, he <lb/>
ran to an extreme natural enough to such a mind, and proclaimed at once <lb/>
that all which is commonly understood by the word Learning was useless. <lb/>
He saw that others mistook the letter for the spirit; and yet in objecting <lb/>
to this mistake, he fell into one of the very same nature, and asserted that <lb/>
learning was no longer wanted, because all the "useful books" in the <lb/>
ancient languages had been translated.  By useful books, he means such <lb/>
works as Euclid's Elements : and here again he fell into an error, from <lb/>
which the true spirit of learning might have saved him : he confounded <lb/>
utility with mere science.  He forgot that for one instance in which mere <lb/>
science is necessary to our happiness, there are a hundred in which we <lb/>
have more to do with our passions and tempers, with our affections, our <lb/>
perceptions, with our ability or inability to extract pleasure from the <lb/>
innumerable things in the intellectual and external world. Utility is only <lb/>
utility in as much as it conduces somehow or other to advantage and <lb/>
pleasure. Every thing that is truly pleasurable or beautiful is as useful <lb/>
as the most scientific thing upon earth. Jane, when she smiles at us, or <lb/>
takes a country walk with us, or reads an author with us, is at least as <lb/>
good as a !Spinning Jenny!. If we have twenty pleasures from the sight of <lb/>
a cherry, such as the admiration of it's bloom, it's figure, it's scent, it's <lb/>
suitableness to the leaves, it's connexion with orchards and the country, <lb/>
and it's association with all that we have read of it in the poets, it is surely <lb/>
better than if we only knew the taste of it, and could reckon how much a <lb/>
dozen of them would come to at a farthing apiece. If we see nothing in <lb/>
the moon but a light for old gentlewomen to go home by, or a satellite to the <lb/>
earth, or even a vague beauty and serenity, we do not receive so much <lb/>
utility from it as when we recollect that it is the very same moon which <lb/>
Homer has so often looked at and so beautifully described,— which said <lb/>
beauty of description is not to be found in the translation of Pope. Now <lb/>
there is scarcely any of all the great poets in other languages, of whom the <lb/>
English reader has had a proper account from translators.  An individual <lb/>
may have so much in him, from nature, of what the writers on the side of <lb/>
beauty and imagination have done for humanity, that he may want little <lb/>
improvement from books. And we all <i>could</i> go on without learning. We <lb/>
all could go on with half, or a quarter, or half a quarter of the science <lb/>
that is now in the world. But if we are to see our way to happiness through <lb/>
knowledge (and we cannot well return to it now-a-davs through the <lb/>
paths of ignorance, beset as they have been with every species of tyranny) <lb/>
then the more we know of what great minds have felt and said, the more <lb/>
we increase the general stock of humanity in its largest sense. That all <lb/>
the "useful books" therefore have been translated, must be denied. <lb/>
Intelligent men of no scholarship, on reading Horace, for instance, and Ariosto, <lb/>
through the medium of translation, have often wondered how those writers <lb/>
obtained their glory. And they well might. The translations are no more <lb/>
like the original than a walking-stick is like a flowering bough. It is the <lb/>


4 THE INDICATOR. 

<pb/>

same with the versions of Euripides, of AEschylus, of Sophocles, of Theocritus, <lb/>
of Petrarch, &c. &c, and in many respects of Homer. Perhaps we <lb/>
could not give the reader a more brief yet complete specimen of the way <lb/>
in which bad translations are made, than by selecting a well-known passage <lb/>
from Shakspeare, and turning it into the common-place kind of poetry <lb/>
that flourished so widely among us till of late years. Take the passage <lb/>
for instance, where the lovers in the Merchant of Venice seat themselves <lb/>
on a bank by moonlight : — </p>

<q>How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! <lb/>
Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music <lb/>
Creep in our ears; soft stillness, and the night, <lb/>
Become the touches of sweet harmony. </q>

<p>Now a foreign translator, of the ordinary kind, would dilute and take <lb/>
all taste and freshness out of this draught of poetry, in a style amounting <lb/>
to the following : — </p>

<q>With what a charm, the moon, serene and bright. <lb/>
Lends on this bank its soft reflected light! <lb/>
Sit we, I pray; and let us sweetly hear <lb/>
The strains melodious with a raptured ear; <lb/>
For soft retreats, and night's impressive hour, <lb/>
To harmony impart divinest power.</q>

<p>It will be our business, where a quotation from the foreign poets occurs to <lb/>
us, to do at any rate a little better than this : and the English reader will <lb/>
have a better idea of the love-stories and other pieces of fiction which they <lb/>
have rendered so celebrated, in abridgments like ours of the utmost brevity <lb/>
and simplicity, than in whole volumes of this kind of misrepresentation. <lb/>
The simple elements of them will be laid before him; and the eye of his <lb/>
own unobstructed heart will see more of what the poets saw in them, at <lb/>
once. </p>


<p>Abaris, a mysterious personage in the time of Pythagoras. He is said <lb/>
to have received an arrow from Apollo, with which he rode through the <lb/>
air, and which he afterwards gave to Pythagoras in return for the instruction <lb/>
of that philosopher. His first appearance at Athens was in consequence <lb/>
of a pestilence which then afflicted the world, and for the cessation <lb/>
of which an oracle had enjoined the Athenians to pray in behalf of all the <lb/>
other nations. Abaris came as the representative of the Hyperboreans. <lb/>
The probability is, that he was a Pythagorean from some northern country; <lb/>
who astonished the Athenians by the rapidity of his journies, and was <lb/>
not sorry perhaps to have it thought supernatural. A metaphor has often <lb/>
been enough to make a miracle. He rode like an arrow. Drop the word <lb/>
like, and the miracle is ready. Swift says of the famous Lord Peterborough,— <lb/>
</p>

<q>So wonderful his expedition, <lb/>
When you have not the least suspicion <lb/>
He's with you like an apparition. </q>

<p>If this had been said of a man in some ages of the world, the next step <lb/>
would have been to use his apparition at once, and allow him a travelling <lb/>
ghost. </p>

<p>Abradates and Panthea, a singular example of conjugal affection on a <lb/>
throne. Abradates was king of Susa in Persia during the wars between <lb/>
Cyrus and Artaxerxes; and hearing that his wife Panthea, who had gotten <lb/>
into the hands of the former, had been treated by him with singular con- <lb/>
tinence and respect, Cyrus having denied himself even the temptation of <lb/>
seeing her, he went over to that prince with all his troops. Unfortunately, <lb/>
he was slain in the first battle that he fought for his new friend; and <lb/>
Panthea, unable to bear the loss of so noble and affectionate a spirit, killed <lb/>
herself on his dead body. The story was first told by Xenophon, Besides <lb/>
it's own interest, it is curious as one of the few specimens afforded by the <lb/>
ancient world, of chivalrous gallantry towards a woman. </p>


<p>Uriel Acosta, a Portuguese at the beginning of the 17th century, <lb/>
presented the world with a strange instance of vacillation in religious faith. <lb/>
He first turned Jew, converting at the same time his mother and brothers, <lb/>
and fled with them to Amsterdam, where they were received into a syna- <lb/>
gogue. Becoming dissatisfied with some of the Jewish rites, and giving vent <lb/>
to his objections, he was excommunicated by the Jews. He then wrote a <lb/>
treatise against the immortality of the soul, for which he was seized and <lb/>
fined. After a lapse of fifteen years, he made his submission, and was <lb/>
again received; but not entirely conforming to the Mosaic law, and <lb/>
having dissuaded two Christians from adopting Judaism, he was again <lb/>
expelled. Under this second sentence he remained seven years, abandoned <lb/>
by his friends, and reduced to an extremity of wretchedness. At last, he <lb/>
again prostrated himself before the Jewish priests, and was again received <lb/>
after an extraordinary penance, during which the most melancholy and ap- <lb/>
palling ceremonies were gone through, candles lighted up and put out, and <lb/>
blood dropped into basons. We speak from the recollection of what <lb/>
we have read 3 but the proceeding was of this description. At the conclu- <lb/>
sion of these infernal ceremonies, he lay down upon the ground at the <lb/>
threshold of the synagogue, and every member of it walked over his body. <lb/>
He shot himself. — Acosta has been idly accused of impiety, and even <lb/>
of worldly selfishness. A man is not full of religious scruples out of impiety; <lb/>
much less keeps out of the pale of his worldly interest over and over again, <lb/>
and for so many years together. Perhaps his history is only an extraor- <lb/>
dinary instance of the perplexity arising from having had progenitors of <lb/>
different faiths. Acosta's father was a Roman- Catholic, but descended <lb/>
from a Jewish stock. The Catholics would naturally wish to keep him <lb/>
Catholic, and the Jews would naturally help his yearnings after Judaism. <lb/>
Perplexed between references to both, his mind wavered; and being an <lb/>
inquiring one, took to thinking for itself; but this was what neither <lb/>
Catholic nor Jew would tolerate. Perplexed by early prejudices; called <lb/>
upon, as it were, by the voices of his ancestors to become a Jew; making <lb/>
bold efforts to disengage himself from this cruel alternative; then plunged <lb/>
in misery; and above all, abandoned by men calling themselves his friends, <lb/>
and whom he had taken for such, a distracted state of mind, weakened per- <lb/>
haps into hopelessness by an atrabilarious temperament, drove him back, <lb/>
like a frightened animal, into the toils of his <i>first fear</i>, the oldest supersti- <lb/>

<pb/>

ition in the family. He stared about him a while, amidst the candles, the <lb/>
curses, and the dropping blood; and then went melancholy, and killed <lb/>
himself. — Thus an honest man is driven into suicide, because his ancestors <lb/>
differed in point of faith! The religionist will say that this shews the value <lb/>
of having one regular hereditary faith; but would he cease then to convert <lb/>
the heretic to his own? And what good did this do to the poor unwilling <lb/>
martyr Acosta? The philosopher will say that it shews the wretched <lb/>
tyranny of custom. </p>


<p>Polyphemus, Acis, and Galatea, one of the most celebrated love-sto- <lb/>
ries in ancient fable. Acis was a mortal, because his mother was so, though <lb/>
his father was the wood-god Faunus. Galatea, who loved him deeply, and <lb/>
whose passion was returned, was an immortal sea-nymph, the daughter of <lb/>
two deities of the ocean. They enjoyed the happiness of their affection in <lb/>
the delightful vales of Sicily; but unfortunately it had one drawback,<lb/>
which was the jealous importunity of Neptune's gigantic and one-eyed son, <lb/>
the terrible Polyphemus. In vain the enamoured monster implored Galatea <lb/>
to listen to him. In vain had love softened the natural ferocity of his <lb/>
manners, so that he would sit whole days on the sea-coast, watching to <lb/>
catch a glimpse of her out of the water, while the tears ran down his <lb/>
dreadful face, and he was as gentle and humble as a child. The fair nymph <lb/>
fled but the more for refuge into the arms of the handsome shepherd. The <lb/>
wretched Polyphemus, looking down one day into a valley, saw the happy <lb/>
lovers giving way to their transport; and this sight made the load of his <lb/>
despair intolerable. He rent off a fragment of the rock on which he was <lb/>
sitting; and hurling it down as Jupiter might do his thunder, smote his <lb/>
rival so as to crush him to death. Galatea, inconsolable, and unable to <lb/>
restore her lover to life, or render him a deity like herself, turned him into <lb/>
a fountain. It was after this event that we may suppose Polyphemus to <lb/>
have become the inhospitable and cruel wretch which he is described <lb/>
to be in Homer's Odyssey : and this point of view helps to throw an <lb/>
additional interest over his story, which always appeared to us one of the <lb/>
most pathetic and deeply-meaning in poetry. He was separated by his <lb/>
monstrous appearance from human kind, and yet in his heart and inclina- <lb/>
tions he sympathized with them. The want of this sympathy from others <lb/>
made him ireful, revengeful, impious. What moral can go to the heart of <lb/>
things more deeply than this? </p>

<p>This story has been a great favourite with all men of genius. It has <lb/>
been touched upon with great pathos and simplicity by Theocritus, who <lb/>
was followed not so well by Virgil, and with much less nature by Ovid. <lb/>
The Italian writers are so fond of it, that they have sonnets, called <lb/>
Polyphemic sonnets. Raphael painted a beautiful picture of Galatea <lb/>
triumphing on the waters, of which there are many engravings. And <lb/>
Handel finished the homage of the arts to it by that divine oratorio of Acis <lb/>
and Galatea, for which Gay contributed words not unworthy. If the reader <lb/>
wishes to know how the great poets have written on the subject, he should <lb/>
hear how Handel composed. </p>

<p>Country Houses near Town. — We have often wondered, in the midst <lb/>
of the trees and fields, how people can be aware of the existence of such <lb/>
beautiful things, and not long to enjoy them : — we mean, of course, in the <lb/>
manner as well as the degree, in which some others enjoy them : for <lb/>
though Nature will be felt and acknowledged some how or other under all <lb/>
her aspects, and though the inhabitants of the metropolis have plenty of <lb/>
little country houses scattered about the skirts of it, yet their pleasure in <lb/>
them is rather of a negative than positive kind; rather a fidgeting respite <lb/>
from smoke and noise, than a sense of the beauties of scenery or of the <lb/>
solitude. When the citizen gets out of the town, he contrives to be almost <lb/>
as much confined as when he is in it. At the best, he generally pokes <lb/>
about his garden a little, and sees that the apple trees are productive, and <lb/>
the brick walls secure. If he goes out, it is chiefly when his neighbours <lb/>
are abroad to meet him, and along the high-road. He may cross the fields <lb/>
in the morning to church, in order to take care of his eternal interests upon <lb/>
the same principle on which he takes care of his temporal every other day <lb/>
in the week; but he confines himself to the path as he, goes; he returns by <lb/>
it as ploddingly; and though not so bad as the sourer' bigot, who after in- <lb/>
sisting all the morning at the meeting house that the world is a vile world, <lb/>
takes all the selfish or unsocial means he can to prove his words, he spends <lb/>
the rest of the day with almost as little sense of the beauties and kindliness <lb/>
of creation, either eating and drinking himself to sleep in his easy chair, or <lb/>
treating some friends with the provisions he stuffed his carriage with the <lb/>
day before, and cultivating a hot-faced, noisy, and boozing indigestion till <lb/>
bed-time. This, and a confinement all the rest of the week to close and <lb/>
noisy streets, — the transition from dark rooms with windows half dust and <lb/>
half board, to the bargaining uproar of an Exchange, — the total ignorance <lb/>
of all intellectual pleasures, an utter deadness to what is called sentiment, <lb/>
— a person which has no graces in consequence, — a face, sometimes jovial <lb/>
but not happy, generally care-worn, and always vulgar, — an enjoyment, <lb/>
such as it is, allied to gambling, and cut with a thousand anxieties, — an <lb/>
unhealthy temperament, always contradicting his comfort also, though he <lb/>
may not know as much, — toil, toil, toil, every morning, — indigestion, <lb/>
indigestion, every evening, — a gout in his old age, and a bad conscience all <lb/>
his life, — such is the picture of a complete, successful, flourishing, sophis- <lb/>
ticated, money-getting animal; who is called "a good man," because his <lb/>
knaveries enable him to pay; and a knowing one, because he has found <lb/>
out with infinite labour and pains how to make himself forty times as un- <lb/>
comfortable as other people. </p>

<p>All this comes from imaginary wants, and from abandoning nature in <lb/>
order to get as much as possible out of art; whereas art with twenty times <lb/>
the toil will never yield a twentieth part of the real harvest. A third of <lb/>
the industry that is now thought necessary, and an improved knowledge <lb/>
which does not confound good taste with expensiveness, would leave man- <lb/>
kind to the enjoyment of a leisure and a happiness, which they have only <lb/>
tasted at intervals. But in the mean time, instead of happiness being <lb/>
attended- to, the phrase is, that "business must be attended to." The <lb/>
same pains, or mere profligacies, are bequeathed to children; and with the <lb/>
exception of a few understandings who have survived the convulsions of <lb/>
the times, and have got hold of a weapon against error", which wisdom never <lb/>
had before, and which we trust it will never let go — the middle classes in <lb/>
this green and beautiful country, make a religion of their money-getting <lb/>

and town habits, sitting in their well-clothed stupidity, and sneering with <lb/>
as much ignorant scepticism at all improvement, as ever their ancestros [sic]<lb/>
might have done in their painted skins. </p>

<p>The present generation, in this respect, is too old and too foolish to <lb/>
mend; but the rising one has new light; and how easily might it see, not <lb/>
only from the sophistications of it's parents, but from their sufferings and <lb/>
even their little unconscious hankerings after something better, the policy <lb/>
of improving it's habits of thinking! How much better would it be to <lb/>
have a third of the toil, and a twentieth part of the anxiety ! How much <lb/>
better to have air and exercise every day, instead of once a week ! How <lb/>
much better to have cheap luxuries, easy digestions, cool slumbers, and <lb/>
quiet minds ! </p>

<p>Nor is this mere talking, or a thing only to be found in books; as if <lb/>
there were no medium between the extreme of folly and that of injustice. <lb/>
Let them come out in the fields, and see. Let them read of the smaller <lb/>
country gentlemen, a class which has since vanished, — of archeries and <lb/>
other rural sports, of the old mixture of business and pleasure, which were <lb/>
in a more reassonable proportion than now; and let them add to these, the <lb/>
improvements which philosophy would now enable them to make in a <lb/>
thousand matters involving the common good; and they would soon see <lb/>
the folly of wasting their time by a mistaken sense of it. </p>

<p>Upon this subject we shall present our readers by and by with a story <lb/>
of a man who never went out of the metropolis for ten years, and what <lb/>
took him out of it at last. </p>
